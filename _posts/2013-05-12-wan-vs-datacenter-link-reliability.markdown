According to a study by Turner et al. [1], wide area network links have an
average of 1.2 to 2.7 days of downtime per year. This translates to roughly
two and a half 9's of reliability [2].

I was curious how this compared to datacenter links, so I took a look at Gill
et. al's paper [3] on datacenter network failures at Microsoft. Unfortunately some
of the data has been redacted, but I was able to reverse engineer the mean
link downtime per year with the help of [Aurojit Panda's](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~apanda/)
[svg-to-points](https://github.com/apanda/svg-points) converter. The results
are interesting: out of all links types, the average downtime was 0.3 days.
This translates to roughly three and a half 9's of reliability, an order of magnitude greater
than WAN links.

Intuitively this makes sense. WAN links are much more prone to
